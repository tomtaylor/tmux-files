# tmux configuration

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Uses reattach-to-user-namespace (available in Homebrew) to allow copying to OSX
system clipboard from inside tmux.

To install:

    git clone https://github.com/tomtaylor/tmux-files.git ~/.tmux
    ln -s ~/.tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
